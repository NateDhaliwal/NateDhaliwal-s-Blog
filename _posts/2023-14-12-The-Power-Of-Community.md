Community is a very powerful thing. It brings people together. It unites them, and strengthens them. <br>
Communities come in different forms. It may be a local neighbourhood community, or a hobby group, or perhaps an online community. Whatever the case, it is made out of people. People who join that community because of similar interests, or to socialise with one another. <br>
When a group of people come together for a similar cause, they usually do so because they are passionate about their cause. They want their voice to be heard. They want change. They want something different. A group of people who want that change can make a very big impact. For example, [Discourse](https://disourse.org) wants to:
> democratize online community and teamwork by raising the standard of civilized discourse on the Internet

<sub>Taken from [here](https://www.discourse.org/about#:~:text=democratize%20online%20community%20and%20teamwork%20by%20raising%20the%20standard%20of%20civilized%20discourse%20on%20the%20Internet)
and Discourse was founded on that mission.
