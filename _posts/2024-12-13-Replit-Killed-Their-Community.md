<h1>How Replit Killed Their Community</h1>


As briefly mentioned in my [first blog post](/NateDhaliwal-s-Blog/2024/12/13/My-First-Post.html), [Replit](https://replit.com) is an online IDE that uses cloud environments. They have a great IDE, and although they destroyed their free plan (a story for another post), they aren't *too* bad. <br>
They've slowly removed aspects of the community, starting with the ability to run repls (projects) from the Cover Page, then removing the ability to follow other users, and even removing the ability to comment on repls.
